# Mastermind-AI
## Requirements
numpy is required to run dependecy. If you are using pip run the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt ```
## Run:
To run the the program run the following command:

```python3 main.py```

## How to use:
After running the program a CLI will appear with 3 options.

1. Type ga to run a simulation of mastermind using the genetic algorithm
2. Type sa to run a simulation of mastermind using the simulated annealing algorithm
3. Type analyse to run both simulations and see their average amount of turns to guess the code.

* Both option 1 and 2 will query the user to type in a code. The code cosists of any combination of four digit that range from 1 to 6
* Option 3 will query the user to type the amount of times to run each simulation.
